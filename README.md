#Major League Miruken

Major League Miruken is a reasonbly complex demo application written to 
show off the features of miruken and give us real code to discuss and 
work through as you learn Miruken.  Craig Neuwirt, Miruken's creator, is 
a huge soccer fan! When he is not working on Miruken or working with Miruken, 
he is playing soccer, and when he is not playing soccer he is coaching
his kids in soccer.  We really had no choice but to build a soccer application.
